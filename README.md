# Homework Submissions for CS 163 (C++ & Data Structures)

### Usage:

You can compile and run each assignment with the following command:  

```bash
/usr/bin/g++ AssignmentName.cpp -o main && ./main
```

### Info:

These are my homework submissions for my senior year compsci class (CS163) at Sunset High School.  
  
Included in the Experiments folder are some of my personal experiments into more advanced C++ techniques, such as
runtime arbitrary assembly execution, and travelling salesman solver algorithms.

I hate doing things the standard way where each assignment is split into lots of tiny header and source files, doing that is
freaking ridiculous if the whole assignment is <300 lines.  F the system, put it all in one nicely commented file
and you save everybody time.

These assignments were compiled and tested on a mac:
